          Hi! I made this website with Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. We were told to create a project about a social issue we care about and education reform and ending student loan debt is something I am passionate about. Every human deserves free and quality education. If we can afford to give our military almost a quarter of our budget, we can afford to give our students free education.
