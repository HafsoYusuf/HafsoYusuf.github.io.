		<h2>Call Your Representatives and Senators</h2>

		<p>
			In July 2021, the House introduced
			<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4797"> H.R.4797 - Student Loan Relief Act</a>. The goal of this bill is to discharge outstanding and certain federal student loan debt; it outlines the method of loan discharge, excludes the loan discharges from taxable income, and it requires the Department of Education to automatically place each federal student loan borrower in administrative forbearance for at least a one-year period.
		</p>

		<br/>

		<p>
			While
				<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4797">H.R.4797 - Student Loan Relief Act</a> has been introduced by the House, but it has been stonewalled by opposing parties. We need your help for this bill to be passed by both the House and Senate and then on to the President's office so it can be signed into law.
