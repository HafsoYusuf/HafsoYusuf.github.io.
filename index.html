      <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          The student loan debt crisis affects over 43 million Americans. Student borrowers are in crisis due to a rise in average debt and declining average wage values. As the devastating health, mental, and economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic deepens, millions of Americans are essentially held back from achieving financial freedom due to job losses, inflation, and the struggle to cover basic necessaries. Student debt cancellation is a matter of racial and economic justice as it disproportionaly impacts Black and Latino borrowers, particulary women. Cancelling student loan debt would lift generations out of poverty. My mission is to bring awareness to this issue through providing information and resources.
